# Changes Summary

## Issue 1: Enhanced Image Preview After Upload in Speaking Page ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Created Enhanced ImageUpload Component** (`src/pages/speaking/components/image-upload.tsx`)
   - Added loading state during upload
   - Improved image preview with better styling
   - Added hover effects for delete buttons
   - Added success/error notifications
   - Larger preview images (120x120 instead of 100x100)
   - Better visual feedback during upload process

2. **Updated Section and SubPart Forms**
   - Replaced basic image upload with enhanced ImageUpload component
   - Better user experience with immediate feedback

## Issue 2: Broke Down Large Speaking Editor into Components ✅

### Original Problem:
- Speaking editor was 1000+ lines in a single file
- Difficult to maintain and understand

### New Component Structure:
1. **SectionForm** (`src/pages/speaking/components/section-form.tsx`)
   - Handles section title, type, order, description, content
   - Manages section images with enhanced upload

2. **SubPartForm** (`src/pages/speaking/components/subpart-form.tsx`)
   - Handles sub-part label, description
   - Manages sub-part images and questions

3. **PointForm** (`src/pages/speaking/components/point-form.tsx`)
   - Handles advantages/disadvantages for Part 3
   - Manages point questions

4. **ImageUpload** (`src/pages/speaking/components/image-upload.tsx`)
   - Reusable image upload component with preview
   - Loading states and error handling

5. **Components Index** (`src/pages/speaking/components/index.ts`)
   - Clean exports for all components

### Benefits:
- **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the app
- **Readability**: Much easier to understand and modify
- **Testing**: Each component can be tested independently

## Issue 3: Fixed JWT and Routing Issues ✅

### Problems Identified:
1. Routes not properly protected
2. JWT token expiration not handled properly
3. After logout, route changes didn't work properly

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Enhanced Auth Provider (`src/providers/auth-provider.tsx`)
- Added `checkAuthStatus()` function to validate JWT tokens
- Added automatic token expiration checking
- Added periodic auth status checking (every minute)
- Better error handling for invalid/expired tokens
- Automatic token refresh when expired

#### 2. Improved Route Guards (`src/routes/guards.tsx`)
- Added route change detection
- Better redirect handling with intended destination
- Proper auth status checking on route changes
- Fixed navigation after logout

#### 3. Updated Login Page (`src/pages/auth/login.tsx`)
- Added redirect to intended destination after login
- Better state management for navigation

#### 4. Fixed API Configuration (`src/config/api.ts`)
- Improved JWT refresh logic
- Better error handling for 401 responses
- Fixed refresh token endpoint usage
- Proper token storage after refresh

### Security Improvements:
- **Token Validation**: Automatic checking of token expiration
- **Route Protection**: All protected routes now properly check authentication
- **Automatic Refresh**: Seamless token refresh without user interruption
- **Proper Logout**: Complete cleanup of tokens and state

## File Structure After Changes:

```
src/pages/speaking/
├── speaking-editor.tsx (refactored, much smaller)
├── components/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── section-form.tsx
│   ├── subpart-form.tsx
│   ├── point-form.tsx
│   └── image-upload.tsx
└── ... (other existing files)
```

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Image Upload**: Test image upload in sections and sub-parts
2. **Authentication**: Test login, logout, and token expiration
3. **Route Protection**: Test accessing protected routes without authentication
4. **Component Isolation**: Test each component independently

## Performance Improvements:

- **Code Splitting**: Components are now modular and can be lazy-loaded
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Better tree-shaking with component separation
- **Faster Development**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality

All changes maintain the existing functionality while significantly improving code quality, user experience, and security.
