## ✅ Issue 2: Clean Code Architecture

### 🎯 **Problem Solved:**
- Speaking editor was 1000+ lines in a single file
- Queries mixed with UI logic
- Difficult to maintain and understand

### 🚀 **Solutions Implemented:**

#### 1. **Separated Queries** (`src/config/queries/speaking/speaking-editor.queries.ts`)
- **Before:** All queries in TSX file
- **After:** Clean separation of concerns

**Extracted Queries:**
- `useGetOneSpeakingTest` - Fetch single speaking test
- `useCreateSpeakingTest` - Create new speaking test
- `useUpdateSpeakingTest` - Update existing test
- `useFileUpload` - Handle file uploads

**Extracted Utilities:**
- `useSpeakingEditor` - All editor logic functions
- Section management (add, update, delete)
- Sub-part management (add, update, delete)
- Question management (add, update, delete)
- Point management (add, update, delete)
- Image management (upload, remove)

#### 2. **Component Breakdown**
- **Before:** 1000+ lines in single file
- **After:** Modular components

**New Components:**
- `SectionForm` - Handles section data and images
- `SubPartForm` - Handles sub-part data and questions
- `PointForm` - Handles advantages/disadvantages
- `ImageUpload` - Enhanced image upload with preview
- `index.ts` - Clean component exports

#### 3. **Clean TSX File**
- **Before:** 1000+ lines with mixed concerns
- **After:** ~300 lines focused on UI only
- All business logic moved to queries file
- Clean, readable, maintainable code
